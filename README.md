JayHUD
======

Me and a friend Jay have been working on this HUD for months now and we've decided that it's time to "release" it.
There will no doubt be some bugs in it but we've been sitting on it for so long that it made sense to just see if
people even like it. 
The first version of the HUD we made looks like this: http://imgur.com/a/pUGu7
The second version of the HUD looks like this: http://imgur.com/a/HLI4P
If people ask for fixes we'll be more inclined to do something about them than we would be otherwise. 
I've also added in fogs crosshairs v3 and most of them are centered for 1920x1080, I can't say for other resolutions.
All of the crosshairs have outlined versions and that can be changed by adding the word "outline" to the font 
the crosshair has in hudlayout.res.

Credit goes to doodle/rays for the sourcescheme and collycat for the chatscheme as well as many others for inspiration.

This has the two different versions of JayHUD that currently exist. At the moment only the box version of 
the HUD works with 4x3 and 16x10. If you have any questions you can leave replys on the tftv thread here
