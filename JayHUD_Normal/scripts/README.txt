To enable the health border (While buffed there is a two pixel border the flashes blue/white, and red/white when low health.) search the hudanimations.txt file for "bonushealth" and delete "//" 
from the start of the lines. This will enable the border but it will remain unseen in minmode, to change this go to hudplayerhealth.res in resource/ui and change the visible_minmode to "1" for the healther border parts.
